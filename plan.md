This simplifies your workload significantly. You can focus on creating quality content and a smooth user experience. For the interactive learning section, consider using a library like `react-codemirror2` for the practice area, as mentioned earlier. This would allow users to write and run code within the browser. For the quiz section, you could store questions and answers in an array or fetch them from a JSON file, then use React state to handle user interactions.
